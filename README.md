Some of the tasks from the Deep Learning for Cognitive Computing course that was held in University of Jyväskylä.
Here, I learned how to use **Tensorflow v1 and v2**, **Sci-kit Learn**, and **Keras** and put them into practice by completing the given tasks.
The tasks inclulded creating CNN, DNN, and RNN models, Linear Regressions, single-layer neural networks, Multi-Layer Perceptrons, as well as sparse and denoising autoencoders.
